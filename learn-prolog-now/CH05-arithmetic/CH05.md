# 5.5 Exercises
## Exercise  5.1
How does Prolog respond to the following queries?

1 X  =  3*4. 3*4
2 X  is  3*4. 12
3 4  is  X. FALSE
4 X  =  Y. Y=X
5 3  is  1+2.  FALSE **TRUE** 
6 3  is  +(1,2). FALSE **TRUE** 
7 3  is  X+2. x = FALSE 
8 X  is  1+2. 3
9 1+2  is  1+2. FALSE **ONLY CALCULATES THE SECOND PART = REASON WHY FALSE BUT 6 IS TRUE**
10 is(X,+(1,2)). X=3 
11 3+2  =  +(3,2). FALSE **TRUE**
12 *(7,5)  =  7*5. TRUE
13 *(7,+(3,2))  =  7*(3+2). TRUE
14 *(7,(3+2))  =  7*(3+2). FALSE **TRUE ITS OKAY FOR THE SUM TO NOT BE WRITTEN USING THE PREDICATE VERSION OF A SUM** 
15 7*3+2  =  *(7,+(3,2)). TRUE 
16 *(7,(3+2))  =  7*(+(3,2)). TRUE


## Exercise  5.2

Define a 2-place predicate increment that holds only when its second argument is an integer one larger than its first argument. 
For example, increment(4,5) should hold, but increment(4,6) should not.

```increment(X,Y):-
    Y is X +1. ``` 

Define a 3-place predicate sum that holds only when its third argument is the sum of the first two arguments. 
For example, sum(4,5,9) should hold, but sum(4,6,12) should not.

```sum(X,Y,Z):-
    Z is X + Y.```

## Exercise  5.3 
Write a predicate addone/2 whose first argument is a list of integers, and whose second argument is the list of integers obtained by adding 1 
to each integer in the first list. For example, the query

   ?-  addone([1,2,7,2],X).
should give

   X  =  [2,3,8,3].
   
   
```
addone([],[]).

addone([H|T],[Hnew|Tnew]):-
    Hnew is H + 1,
    addone(T,Tnew).```
